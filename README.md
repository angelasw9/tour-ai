# Tour AI Realtime Translation

This project is a Node.js application that provides real-time speech translation for tour guides and visitors. It streams audio from a tour guide, converts the speech to text using Azure Cognitive Services, translates the text to multiple languages, synthesizes the translated speech, and serves the resulting audio to visitors via WebSockets.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js `>=18`** â€“ see the engines field in `package.json`.
- npm (comes with Node).
- Azure Cognitive Services credentials for Speech and Translator APIs.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
AZURE_KEY=<your Azure API key>
AZURE_REGION=<Azure region, e.g. eastasia>
```

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in a browser and choose either the guide or visitor interface.
